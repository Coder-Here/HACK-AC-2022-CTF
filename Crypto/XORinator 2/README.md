Title: XORinator2

Description:
```
Curse you, Marcus the Duck!

This time round I have increased my secret key length to be 14 bytes long!

In addition, most of the characters in the message are now non-printable ASCII.

The only hint that I will give you is that the string "0iwMIGhTMfd8ti" appears in the message.

Let's see if you can still decode the message to get the flag!
