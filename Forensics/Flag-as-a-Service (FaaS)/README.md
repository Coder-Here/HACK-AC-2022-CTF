Title: Flag-as-a-Service (FaaS)

Description:
```
Recently, I've learnt of this new cloud business model to earn MORE money FAST! 
They claim to be powered by blockchain with a fully AGILE WATERFALL. 
Anyways, I stole one of their lead developers phone to earn some money for myself, but I couldn't make sense of the data. 
Can you help me to steal their business plan?
