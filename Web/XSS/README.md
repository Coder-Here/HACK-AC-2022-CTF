Title: XSS

Decription:
```
I really hate script kiddies... There was one guy recently going around talking about his new website. All he did was copy my website!!! >:(

Now all he does all day is look at the new posts people send him... He even announced that he uses a password autofill manager to make sure no one steals his creds and views his own post. We need to teach these script kiddies a lesson!

btw you can sign up for an account just by logging in with your new creds (that's how kool my site is)

Given hint: Do read through the bot's code and identify which nodes the Selenium driver looks for, and find a way to extract the input to a webhook
